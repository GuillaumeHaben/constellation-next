# 🎯 Vision
Build a clean, modular social platform where users can:
- get to know each other more easily
- find colleagues with similar interests / background / projects
- use a correct app instead of Signal to trade / list appartments / shared accommodations
- learn about who is involved in what social club, the history of the club
- stay in touch with alumni once they leave ESA. Get to know which ESA alumni is in which city.
